        Instagram allows you to request a machine-readable export of your followers and following. This tool will
        calculate the difference between these two: who doesn't follow back and vice versa.
      </p>
      <!-- <p class="mt-3">
        Additionally, you can upload exports from
        <i>two different days</i>, and it will tell you who has unfollowed you between them.

          When it's time to share your data, you can turn on <b>Airplane Mode ✈</b> to ensure your data isn't leaving
          your phone.
