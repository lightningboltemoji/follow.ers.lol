    <div>
      <p>
        Instagram allows you to request a machine-readable export of your followers and following.
        By uploading it here, this tool will tell you who doesn't follow back and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you can upload exports from
        <i>two different days</i>, and it will tell you who has unfollowed you between them.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Before uploading your data, turn on Airplane Mode âœˆ to ensure your data couldn't possibly
        leave your phone.

        This tool was built by
        <ext-link href="https://tanner.cecchetti.xyz">me</ext-link>. You don't really have any way
        to verify this, but I'm just a (relatively) normal person that made this for fun. There's no
        secret agenda.
