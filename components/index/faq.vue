      <p>
        Instagram allows you to request a machine-readable export of your followers and following.
        By uploading it here, this tool will tell you who doesn't follow back and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, you can upload exports from
        <i>two different days</i>, and it will tell you who has unfollowed you between them.

          Before uploading your data, turn on Airplane Mode âœˆ to ensure your data can't leave your
          phone.

          This tool was built by
          <ext-link href="https://tanner.cecchetti.xyz">me</ext-link>. You don't really have any way
          to verify this, but I'm just a (relatively) normal person that made this for fun. There's
          no secret agenda.
