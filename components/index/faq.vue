        Instagram allows you to request a machine-readable export of your followers and following. By uploading it here,
        this tool will tell you who doesn't follow back and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Additionally, you can upload exports from
        <i>two different days</i>, and it will tell you who has unfollowed you between them.

          This project is open source, so you can
          <ext-link href="https://github.com/lightningboltemoji/follow.ers.lol">read the code</ext-link>
          if that's your thing!

          This tool was built by
          <ext-link href="https://tanner.cecchetti.xyz">me</ext-link>. You don't really have any way to verify this, but
          I'm just a (relatively) normal person that made this for fun. There's no secret agenda.
