        <p>
          Instagram allows you to request a machine-readable export of your
          followers and following. By uploading it here, this tool will tell you
          who doesn't follow back and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you can upload exports from
          <i>two different days</i>, and it will tell you who has unfollowed you
          between them.

      <h2>How do I know you're not saving my data?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before uploading your data, turn on Airplane Mode âœˆ to ensure your
          data couldn't possibly leave your phone.

          really have any way to verify this, but I'm just a normal person that
          built this for fun. There's no ulterior motive.
